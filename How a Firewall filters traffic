How a Firewall Filters Traffic

Traffic Monitoring:
The firewall watches all incoming and outgoing network traffic on your device or network.

Rules and Policies:
It uses a set of predefined rules (firewall rules) that specify what types of traffic are allowed or blocked. These rules are based on things like:

IP addresses (source or destination)

Ports (source or destination port numbers)

Protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

Direction (inbound or outbound)

Programs or services involved

Decision Making:
For each network packet, the firewall checks the rules in order and decides whether to:

Allow the packet through (if it matches an “allow” rule)

Block/Drop the packet (if it matches a “block” rule)

Reject the packet (actively refuse connection)

Enforcement:
The firewall then either passes the allowed traffic on to the application/network or blocks the denied traffic from reaching it.

Logging and Alerts:
Many firewalls log blocked or suspicious traffic and can alert administrators about potential security issues
